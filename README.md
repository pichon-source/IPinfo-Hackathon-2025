# IPinfo-Hackathon-2025
Smart Cybersecurity Dashboard with IPInfo

What You're Seeing
At the top, we have our real-time status panel showing:

378,358 IP networks actively monitored (this is real data from IPinfo Lite)
10 strategic countries selected for geopolitical threat analysis
6 high-risk threat sources requiring immediate attention
2,847 ISPs tracked across these regions

The Intelligence Behind It
We didn't just randomly pick countries. This dashboard monitors:
Critical threat actors: North Korea, Iran, Syria, Yemen
Geopolitically sensitive: Russia, Belarus, Afghanistan
Baseline comparisons: US, Israel, China

Each country gets a dynamic risk score from 1-10 based on current geopolitical factors and cyber threat intelligence.
Visual Intelligence
Left chart shows threat distribution - notice how the US dominates with 310K networks but gets a low risk score of 1, while North Korea has only 6 networks but maxes out at risk level 10. This isn't about volume - it's about threat sophistication.
Right chart focuses on high-risk ISPs from our threat countries. See those red bars? Those are telecommunications providers in Iran, Syria, Yemen - exactly where state-sponsored cyber activities originate.
Interactive Threat Map
Click any country card and you get detailed threat analysis:

Network breakdown by ISP
Specific ASN (Autonomous System Number) data
Actionable security recommendations

Notice the color-coded risk levels:

ðŸ”´ Critical (Red): North Korea, Iran - immediate blocking recommended
ðŸŸ  High (Orange): Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan - enhanced monitoring
ðŸŸ¡ Medium (Yellow): Russia, Belarus - watch for patterns
ðŸŸ¢ Low (Green): US, Israel - standard protocols

Live Threat Intelligence
Watch the alerts! Every few seconds, our system simulates real security events:

Port scanning attempts
Failed authentication clusters
DDoS pattern detection
Unusual traffic anomalies

Technical Innovation
Behind the scenes, this runs entirely client-side - no servers, no databases, just pure JavaScript processing your actual IPinfo data in real-time. The visualizations are custom CSS animations, not heavy charting libraries, making it lightning-fast and deployment-ready anywhere.


# This is actionable cybersecurity intelligence:
Real IPinfo data - not fake samples
Geopolitical awareness - security teams think this way
Immediate deployment - works offline, no dependencies
Practical recommendations - tells you what to DO with the data

Questions? Click any country, press 'A' for alerts, or 'R' to refresh the threat landscape!




How this dashboard would integrate with real-world cybersecurity infrastructure?
Real-World Implementation
Data Integration Pipeline
Instead of static IPinfo data, you'd connect:

Network Traffic Sources:

Firewall logs (pfSense, Cisco ASA, Fortinet)
Web server access logs (Apache, Nginx)
SIEM systems (Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar)
Cloud WAF logs (Cloudflare, AWS WAF, Azure)


Live Data Flow:
javascript// Real implementation would look like:
async function fetchLiveTraffic() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/traffic/last-hour');
  const traffic = await response.json();
  
  // Extract unique IPs from traffic
  const uniqueIPs = [...new Set(traffic.map(req => req.source_ip))];
  
  // Batch lookup with IPinfo API
  const geoData = await Promise.all(
    uniqueIPs.map(ip => fetch(`https://ipinfo.io/${ip}?token=${API_KEY}`))
  );
  
  updateThreatMap(geoData);
}


Real-Time Architecture
Production setup would involve:

Log Aggregation Layer:
Collects logs from all sources
Normalizes IP addresses
Filters internal/private IPs


Threat Intelligence Engine:
Queries IPinfo API for geolocation
Cross-references with threat feeds
Calculates risk scores in real-time


Dashboard Updates:
WebSocket connections for live updates
Server-sent events for alert streaming
Real-time country/ISP statistics


Enterprise Integration Example
Security Operations Center (SOC) Use Case:
Morning scenario: SOC analyst opens dashboard and sees:

Spike in traffic from Iran - 47 new IPs in last hour
Alert: Multiple login failures from AS44244 (Iran Cell)
Action: Click Iran card â†’ See specific IP ranges â†’ Add to firewall block list

API Integration Points:
javascript// Real production endpoints:
GET /api/threats/live          // Current threat landscape
GET /api/traffic/country/{code} // Traffic by country
POST /api/blocks/add           // Add IPs to blocklist
GET /api/incidents/active      // Active security incidents
Automated Response Integration:
The dashboard would trigger:

Firewall rules: Auto-block high-risk countries
SIEM alerts: Generate tickets for suspicious patterns
Notification systems: Slack/Teams alerts for critical threats
Incident response: Automatic playbook execution

Data Refresh Cycle
Real implementation timeline:

Every 5 minutes: Traffic log analysis
Every 15 minutes: Geo-IP lookups for new addresses
Every hour: Risk score recalculation
Daily: Threat intelligence feed updates

Business Value
Real SOC teams would use this for:

Threat Hunting: "Show me all traffic from high-risk ASNs"
Incident Response: "What countries attacked us this week?"
Policy Decisions: "Should we block entire countries?"
Executive Reporting: "Here's our global threat landscape"

Next Steps for Production
To make this enterprise-ready:

Backend API with real traffic processing
Database for historical threat data
Authentication and role-based access
Integration APIs for SIEM/firewall systems
Mobile app for on-call incident response
